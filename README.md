Scrap Yields No Solid Fuel
---

Make scrap recycling yield no solid fuel. A simple factorio mod that does exactly what it says.

The base game provides solid fuel from scrap recycling to ensure that you can't softlock yourself on
Fulgora if you land without supplies, as you can use the solid fuel in a furnace to turn stone into
stone bricks. But if you're willing to bring enough supplies to bootstrap your Fulgora base from
nothing, then this mod removes the large amount of solid fuel made by scrap recycling.

Fulgora feels to me like one should make solid fuel from the infinite heavy oil available from the
oceans, and this mod actually makes you do it.
